# FaceLok Mobile - Supported Platforms

The SDK supports the following platforms and architectures:

| Operating System | Version | Architectures | Unsupported |
| ---------------- | ------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| iOS - Phone |	8.0+ | armv7, armv7s, arm64, arm64e, simulator64 | tvos, watchos, simulator (32-bit) |
| Android | android-21+ | armv7a, x86, x86_6, arm64-v8a |

**Simulator Note:** The majority of the SDK will require a camera. If you have a simulator with a camera you should be able to use the simulator build.

32-bit simulator for iOS is **not** included since any machine newer than 2008 for a mac is 64-bit.

## Xamarin

Xamarin libraries are provided for ios and android as well with all the architectures above supported.
