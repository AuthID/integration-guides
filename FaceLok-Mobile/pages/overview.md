# FaceLok Mobile - Overview

## Introduction

This SDK provides a mobile application (iOS or Android) the ability to capture a users biometric image using the camera on a mobile device. This process performs a liveness test which requires a user to blink and smile as well as other security countermeasures.

For iOS development this SDK is provided as a framework, FaceLok.framework, that can be used with Objective-C and Swift.

For Android development this SDK is provided as an android archive, FaceLok.aar, that can be used with Java.

Sample applications are also provided to demonstrate the functionality of this SDK. You can see examples of using this SDK in the following sections:

- [Project Setup](./projectsetup.md)
- [Using FacelokInterface](./usingfacelokint.md)
